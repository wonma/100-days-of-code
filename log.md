# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 08/15/2022

**Today's Progress**: Understood what is Unit testing and why we need to do testing.

- Unit testing: Testing the smallest units of code in isolation (fast)
- Why we test codes: To make sure a software behaves as expected

**Thoughts:** What I'm learning is the basic concepts. I feel a bit in rush wanting to do code exercises but it is okay to spend time in learning the concepts without actually coding as long as I'm learning something new!

### Day 2: 08/16/2022

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed the concept of a prototype object, inheritance with the construction of classes. Understand what data structure is and why we need to talk about it.

- Data Structure: it is about how to store data so that it can be used efficiently in completing a certain type of task. (Object, Array, Map, Set, etc.)
- 'Map' data structure example:
<code>
const contacts = new Map()
contacts.set('Jessie', {phone: "213-555-1234", address: "123 N 1st Ave"})
contacts.has('Jessie') // true
contacts.get('Hilary') // undefined
</code>
- 'Set' data structure example: 
<code>
const repetitiveFruits = ['apple','pear','apple','pear','plum', 'apple'];
const uniqueFruits = new Set(repetitiveFruits);
console.log(uniqueFruits); // {'apple', 'pear', 'plum'}
</code>

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
