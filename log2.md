### Day 001: September 8, Friday

**Solved**
- FreeCodeCamp Code Challenge: [Sum All Numbers in a Range](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting/sum-all-numbers-in-a-range)

**Today I Learned**
- .slice() method: used to copy an array or part of an array
    - arr.slice() returns a copied array, not modifying the original array
    - arr.slice(startIndex, endIndexNotInclusive) copies the specified range of items from the original array 
- Gauss formula: used to get a sum of the series of integers
    - [Gauss formula](http://mathcentral.uregina.ca/QQ/database/QQ.02.06/jo1.html)
- How to destructure an array to easily assign the items into variables. 
- How to use the Array spread operator to copy an array
- .sort() method: the shortcomings of this array sorting method? It strictly follows Unicode code points. May end up with unexpected results. We can write a comparison function as a callback to precisely sort the items in an ascending or descending order.
    - [How to sort an array accurately](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-sort-javascript-array-accurately/) 
 
**To Study Further**
- Solving the same problem with recursion and the reduce method

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
