# My #100DaysOfCode Challenge

## Goal and Intention

My goal is to be a happy coder and problem solver. My intention is not on becoming better than others or gaining ability to show off. I will focus on developing healthy mindset and attitude to enjoy problem solving, uncertainty, and continuous challenges as a happy front-end developer.
